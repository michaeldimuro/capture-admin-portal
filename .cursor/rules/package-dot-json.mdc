# 📦 Package Management Rules

To ensure consistency and avoid dependency issues across all environments, please follow the rules below when working with `package.json` and managing project dependencies.

---

## 🚫 Do NOT Edit `package.json` Directly

### ❌ Forbidden:
- Manually adding or removing entries in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.
- Editing version numbers directly.
- Renaming or moving script commands inside `scripts`.

---

## ✅ Required: Use `npm` or `yarn` Commands

### Always install or remove packages using the CLI:
- To install a package:
  ```bash
  npm install <package-name>        # For production dependency
  npm install --save-dev <package>  # For development dependency
